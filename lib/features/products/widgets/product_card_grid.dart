/// less content are left with dead space at the bottom. Here each row is a
/// plain Row of Expanded cells: Flex already sizes itself to its tallest
/// child with no stretch needed (ProductCard's Column is mainAxisSize.min,
/// so it never fills extra height anyway), so a row of short cards shrinks
/// and a row with one long card doesn't affect any other row.
///
/// Deliberately NOT using IntrinsicHeight here — it forces a two-pass
/// intrinsic layout on its child, and ProductCard contains a Hero; that
/// combination trips a framework assertion during Hero flight
/// ('!semantics.parentDataDirty') because RenderIntrinsicHeight doesn't
/// correctly hand off semantics parent data while its child is reparented
/// into the Hero overlay mid-animation.
